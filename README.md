# Refinance app

## Project Overview

### Introduction

This is a portfolio project I did as part of my full stack engineer course on Codecademy. The goal of the project was to
showcase all previews skills and technologies learned until this point on the path (HTML / CSS, JavaScript, React, Redux, Git and Github Projects, Command line, Wireframes).
It is a React-Redux app that allows the user to view Reddit posts from various subreddits orientated to the finance field. The app requires authentication with the user's Reddit account to be used, and mainly displays posts containing finance topics.

### Project Requirements

- Build the application using React and Redux

- Version control your application with Git and host the repository on GitHub

- Use a project management tool (GitHub Projects, Trello, etc.) to plan your work

- Write a README (using Markdown) that documents your project including:

    * Wireframes
    * Technologies used
    * Features
    * Future work
- Write unit tests for your components using Jest and Enzyme

- Write end-to-end tests for your application

- Users can use the application on any device (desktop to mobile)

- Users can use the application on any modern browser

- Users can access your application at a URL

- Users see an initial view of the data when first visiting the app

- Users can search the data using terms

- Users can filter the data based on categories that are predefined

- Users are shown a detailed view (modal or new page/route) when they select an item

- Users are delighted with a cohesive design system

- Users are delighted with animations and transitions

- Users are able to leave an error state

- Get 90+ scores on Lighthouse

We understand you cannot control how media assets like videos and images are sent to the client. It is okay to have a score below 90 for Performance if they are related to the media from Reddit.
- OPTIONAL: Get a custom domain name and use it for your application

- OPTIONAL: Set up a CI/CD workflow to automatically deploy your application when the master branch in the repository changes

- OPTIONAL: Make your application a progressive web app
